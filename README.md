I realized that through this platform,which is our website, we as the youths could reach out to the youths of the world and bring to their awareness the social injustices, issues, and potential solutions we have to offer. I attract such a market through our uniquely designed clothings; Designs which are unprecedented to the world market. The theme of our website is dependent on the impending global issues we face.
Setting Up:
Open the project directory get the HTTPS URL. Then open gitbash and type - gitclone + the URL. Project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This clones the project and you will have access to the files. Search for home_test. Make sure everything is in a single folder for the images to appear on the website.

I use the test pyramid strategy to test our end to end tests. This allows the source of the problem to be identified quickly.
